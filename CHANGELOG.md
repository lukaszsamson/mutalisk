# Changelog

All notable changes to Mutalisk are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## v1.6 (M17, 2026-05-05)

### Changed
- **`mix mut` defaults to parallel execution.** The default
  `--concurrency` is now `min(System.schedulers_online(), 4)`, capped
  at 4. Use `--concurrency 1` for v1.5 sequential behaviour.
  Outcomes are byte-identical across `c=1/2/4/8` on demo_app,
  plug_crypto, and Decimal (M17 validation matrix).
- Decimal-class projects (e.g. `lukaszsamson/decimal@mutalisk-bench`)
  now complete comfortably under 30 minutes at the new default. See
  `BENCHMARKS.md` "Concurrency speedup curve (M17)" for full numbers.

### Added
- Reports include concurrency metadata.
  - Terminal summary prints a `Concurrency: N workers` line near
    the bottom (with `(sequential)` or `(capped at N
    schedulers_online)` suffix when applicable).
  - Stryker JSON gains a top-level `mutalisk.concurrency` block:
    `{ "configured", "effective", "schedulers_online" }`.
- Reports distinguish fallback recompile failures by category.
  - `:compile_error` — patched Elixir source did not compile.
  - `:dep_path_error` — required module not loadable from `-pa`.
  - `:unknown` — non-zero exit without a known signature.
  - Terminal summary surfaces a "recompile errors" sub-block under
    Fallback when total > 0.
  - Stryker JSON gains `mutalisk.recompile_categories` counts.
- New `Mut.SandboxQueue` (PROMPT_16, hardened in M17) audited and
  regression-tested under 32-task / 8-sandbox concurrent stress.
- New `Mut.LastKiller` concurrent stress test plus a p99 latency
  regression bar (sub-millisecond record_kill).

### Fixed
- M17 sandbox audit captured no behavioural fixes (the existing
  sandbox lifecycle is concurrency-safe), but the audit's
  regression test guards against future regressions.

### Internal
- `%Mut.Metrics.Snapshot{}` carries `concurrency` and
  `recompile_categories` fields.
- `Mut.Worker.Result{}` carries `recompile_category`.
- `Mut.Recompile.categorize/1` is the public classifier.

## v1.5 (M15 + M16)

- Coverage-aware test selection (`--selection coverage`,
  `--selection coverage_with_static_fallback`).
- Phase timing metrics in reports.
- See `BENCHMARKS.md` v1.5 section for outcomes.

## v1 (M0–M14)

- Schema-engine + fallback-engine mutation execution.
- Stryker-compatible JSON reporter.
- See `BENCHMARKS.md` v1 reference run.
